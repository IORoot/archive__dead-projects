# Page Taxonomy for Delivey Method.

Adds a new "delivery method" taxonomy to pages:

This allows you to classify pages, so you know how they are being used.

# AMP

If you add the delivery method `amp` to a page, the listings page `https://dev.londonparkour.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=page` will highlight the row in Yellow (#FCC53B).

# Mobile

Categorising a page with a `mobile` term will highlight it as blue `#27C9C1`.
