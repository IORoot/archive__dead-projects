# Article Featured & View Count


## Featured
Adds a 'featured' button on the articles so it can be used on the article dashboard.
The main flickity slider (at the top of the main dashboard) will show only 'featured' articles.
Use this button to make it featured.

## View Count
The view count will go up everytime the post is viewed. The `themes/londonparkour.com_v4/template-parts/content-article.php`
file will update the view count when loaded.

### Bug
It seems to update the viewcount by 2 every time.
